# Apache and PHP on Docker

This is a basic Docker environment for PHP development, based on [carcel/php](https://hub.docker.com/r/carcel/php).

It is not intended to use directly as it stands, but rather to extend it and create custom development environments.

It provides a pre-configured Apache (2.4) + mod_php (PHP 7.0) web server, based on Debian 8 (Jessie).
Apache is configured to run with the `docker` user. It is then preferred to place your PHP application in `/home/docker`
and modify the default VHOST to access it.

The environment come with  some PHP extensions: apcu, mcrypt, intl, mysql, curl, gd, mongo, soap, xml, zip, and xdebug
(this last one comes deactivated, run `phpenmod xdebug` and restart Apache to enable it).

## How to use it?

### From Docker hub

You can directly pull this image from [Docker hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/carcel/apache-php/) by running:

```bash
$ docker run --name apache-php -p 8080:80 -d carcel/apache-php:php-7.0
```

Access the URL `localhost:8080` with your web browser to check that the container works.

### From GitHub

Clone the repository, go inside the created folder, and build the docker image:

```bash
$ docker build -t "apache-php" .
```

Then you can run a container like this:

```bash
$ docker run --name apache-php -p 8080:80 -d apache-php
```
