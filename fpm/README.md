# PHP FPM on Docker

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/akeneo/Dockerfiles.svg?branch=php-7.1)](https://travis-ci.org/akeneo/Dockerfiles/tree/php-7.1)

This is a basic Docker environment for PHP FPM development, based on [akeneo/php](https://hub.docker.com/r/akeneo/php). **This image does not contain Akeneo PIM**.

It is intended to be used [httpd](https://hub.docker.com/_/httpd) with FCGI enable or [nginx](https://hub.docker.com/_/nginx).

It comes with Debian 9 (Stretch) and PHP 7.1 (from [Sury repository](https://deb.sury.org/)), and some PHP extensions: fpm of course, but also apcu, mcrypt, intl, mysql, curl, gd, mongo, soap, xml, zip, and xdebug (this last is deactivated by default, run `phpenmod xdebug` to enable it).

The PHP FPM daemon is configured with "docker" as user and group, and listens to the port `9001`.

## How to use it

### From Docker hub

You can directly pull this image from [Docker hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/akeneo/apache-php/) by running:

```bash
$ docker run -d --name akeneo-fpm akeneo/fpm:php-7.1
```

### From GitHub

Clone the repository, go inside the created folder, and build the docker image:

```bash
$ docker build -t akeneo-fpm .
```

Then you can run a container like this:

```bash
$ docker run --name akeneo-fpm -d akeneo-fpm
```
