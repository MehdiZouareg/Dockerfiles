# Contributing

These Dockerfiles are not only made for my personal use, but for anybody who likes to develop on Akeneo or Symfony applications with Docker.

I gladly accept any contributions: fixing typos, glitches, bugs, technical enhancements and new features.

For technical enhancements and new features, please first have a look at [current issues](https://github.com/damien-carcel/Dockerfiles/issues).
There may already be one, with details and ideas on how to implement it. You are welcome to pick it and propose a pull request if you'd like.

If it does not already exist, please first open an issue to describe and discuss what you want to do, it will ease the merge of your pull request.
