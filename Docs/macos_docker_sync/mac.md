# Development on a Mac using docker-sync
Due performance issues while developing on a Mac itâ€™s necessary to use docker-sync.

## Requirements
Install [docker-sync](http://docker-sync.io/):
```bash
# gem install docker-sync
```

Install [unison](https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~bcpierce/unison/):
```bash
$ brew install unison
```

## File locations
Just like the compose file template copy `docker-sync.yml.dist` and `docker-compose.mac.yml.dist` to the root of your project or next to you `docker-compose.yml` if you placed it somewhere else. In this case, you'll have to change the src parameter from `./` to `/the/path/to/your/pim`. Also don't forget to get rid of the `.dist` file extension for both files. ;)

## Starting the machine
To start the machine just use the following command:
```bash
docker-sync-stack start
```
To see what this command really does, have a look at the offical docker-sync [wiki](https://github.com/EugenMayer/docker-sync/wiki/2.2-sync-stack-commands).

## How to run commands inside of the container
Nothing has changed here for you. You can still use `docker-compose`.
