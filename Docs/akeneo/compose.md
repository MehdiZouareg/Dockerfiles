# Akeneo development and testing with docker-compose

**IMPORTANT - These images do not contain Akeneo.** 
They are intended to be used with an already existing (or new) Akeneo project on your host machine, that will be mounted as a data volume.

Two compose file examples are already included in `akeneo/pim-community-dev` and `akeneo/pim-enterprise-dev` starting with version 1.5, 
and`akeneo/pim-community-standard` and `akeneo/pim-enterprise-standard` starting with version 1.7.

Both provide two environments, one for development, the other for running tests (functional tests with behat and integration tests with PHP Unit) for dev editions. Standard editions come only with dev environment.

- [**The first compose file**](https://github.com/akeneo/pim-community-dev/blob/1.7/docker-compose.yml.dist) provides Apache + mod_php (PHP 5.6):
    - It uses [`akeneo/apache:php-5.6`](https://hub.docker.com/r/akeneo/apache-php/), [`mysql:5.5`](https://hub.docker.com/_/mysql/),
      [`selenium/standalone-firefox-debug:2.53.1-beryllium`](https://hub.docker.com/r/selenium/standalone-firefox-debug/),
      and optionally [`mongodb:2.4`](https://hub.docker.com/_/mongo/).
    - You can access the full documentation regarding this compose file [here](https://github.com/akeneo/Dockerfiles/blob/master/Docs/akeneo/mod_php.md).
    - **This compose file is the recommended one to use with Akeneo 1.7 and previous versions.**
    
- [**The second one**](https://github.com/akeneo/pim-community-dev/blob/master/docker-compose.yml.dist) provides FPM (PHP 7.1) with Apache 2.4 (with FCGI enabled):
    - It uses [`akeneo/fpm:php-7.1`](https://hub.docker.com/r/akeneo/fpm/),  [`httpd:2.4`](https://hub.docker.com/_/httpd/), [`mysql:5.7`](https://hub.docker.com/_/mysql/),
      [docker.elastic.co/elasticsearch/elasticsearch:5.5.2](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/docker.html),
      and [`selenium/standalone-firefox-debug:2.53.1-beryllium`](https://hub.docker.com/r/selenium/standalone-firefox-debug/) for behat testing.
    - You can access the full documentation regarding this compose file [here](https://github.com/akeneo/Dockerfiles/blob/master/Docs/akeneo/fpm.md).
    - **This compose file is the recommended one to use with Akeneo 2.x.**
